In programming, we need to execute set of code repeatedly until the stated condition becomes false. This is called looping statement or iteration.


Factorial of a number : [C++] 

#include <bits/stdc++.h
using namespace std;

int fact(n){

}

int main(){
    int n; cin>>n;
    cout << fact(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
