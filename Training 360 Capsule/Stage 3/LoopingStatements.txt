In programming, we need to execute set of code repeatedly until the stated condition becomes false. This is called looping statement or iteration.


Factorial of a number : [C++] 

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long

ll fact(ll n){
    return (n == 1 || n == 0) ? 1 : n * fact(n - 1);
}

int main(){
    ll n; cin>>n;
    cout << fact(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
