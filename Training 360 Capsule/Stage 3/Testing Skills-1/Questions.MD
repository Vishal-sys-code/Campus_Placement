## Handshakes

It was Raj's first day at school. His teacher Anu asked the students to meet every other student in the class and introduce about themselves. The teacher asked them to handshake with each other when they meet. If there are n number of students in the class then find the total number of handshakes made by the students.
INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of 1 integer. First input corresponds to the total number of students. The output consists of 1 integer.

SAMPLE INPUT:

15

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

105

## Dollars & Cents

Write a C++ program to add two dollars and cents.
INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of 4 integers. First two inputs correspond to the value of the first dollar and cent. Next two inputs correspond to the value of the second dollar and cent. Output should print the sum of dollar and cent.

## Chalk
Raj's teacher Anu uses chalk to write on the board. When the chalk reduces to 1/squareroot(n) of its original size, she keeps the chalk aside as it gets too small. She joins all the small pieces of the chalk and makes another chalk of the same size and uses it. If she uses one chalk each day, in how many days will she use the given n number of chalks?
INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of 1 integer which corresponds to the number of chalks given. Output corresponds to the number of days in which the given number of chalks will be used.

SAMPLE INPUT:

16

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

21

## Harshad Number

Write a C++ program to find whether the given number is a Harshad number or not. Note that Harshard number is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits.
INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of 1 integer. If the given number is a Harshad Number, display "Harshad Number" or display "Not Harshad Number".

SAMPLE INPUT:

1729

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

Harshad Number

## Collatz problem
The rules for generating Collatz sequence are: If n is even: n = n / 2 If n is odd: n = 3n + 1 For example, if the starting number is 5 the sequence is: 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 It has been proved for almost all integers, that the repeated application of the above rule will result in a sequence that ends in 1. Now, write a C++ program to generate the Collatz sequence.
INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

The input is an integer 'n' which denotes the first term of the sequence.

As output, print the numbers in the sequence and also print the number of times the rule has to be applied in order to reach 1.
