## Automated Dictation Evaluation I
These days kids are introduced to computers at a very early age and in some schools, the dictation test is conducted using computers. The teachers found it a bit difficult to evaluate these tests and they requested the school management to lessen their burden by automating this task. The 12th class students are learning C++ programming and they took up the task of automating the dictation evaluation. You need to check if the given string is equal to the correct string to evaluate each student. Can you please help them out? Write a C++ program to compare 2 strings using strcmp() function.

INPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of two strings.

Assume that the maximum length of the string is 50 and it contains only alphabets.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT:

## Nursery Admission
The kids need to clear a simple test to secure admission in the nursery class. They need to spell their name and they also need to tell the number of letters in their name. Some of the kids had very long names and the interview panel members found it time-consuming to count the number of letters in the name. One of the panel members has just started to learn programming and she decided to write a C++ program to count the number of charaters in the name. She knew that it was an easy task as the good old strlen function is availabe in C++. Can you help her out in this task? Write a C++ program to find the number of characters in the string.
Input Format:

Input consists of a single string. 

Assume that the maximum length of the string is 50 and it contains only alphabets.

Output Format:

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

Sample Input:

Punitha

Sample Output:

The number of letters in the name is 7

Case1:
```
Input (stdin)
Punitha

Output (stdout)
The number of letters in the name is 7
```

Case2:
```
Input (stdin)
Siva

Output (stdout)
The number of letters in the name is 4
```

Case3:
```
Input (stdin)
Ram

Output (stdout)
The number of letters in the name is 3
```

Special school
A special school is run by an NGO for kids with Dyslexia. We all know these children will start writing the letters backward or in reverse. Once special care is taken to correct this issue and once they are introduced to words, they will start writing the words in the proper format. The teachers do not want to discourage the children at the start itself and they have decided to mark the words written in reverse also as correct. Can you please help the teacher in correcting the answer sheets by writing a C++ program? Write a C++ program to check whether the second word is the reverse of the first word. Do not use strrev() function.
Input Format:

Input consists of 2 strings. 

Assume that the maximum length of the string is 50.

Output format:

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

## Remove character except alphabets

In a blind organization, they were playing the typing a keyword game and they want to correct the form of the word. So help them to by writing a program to remove all special symbols and print the characters of a string.
Input & output Format:

Input consists of a string. Assume the maximum length of the string is 200. The characters in the string can contain both uppercase, lowercase, and symbols.

Sample Input:

pro$#&gra7m

Sample Output:

program

Case 1:
```
Input (stdin)
Code&^L5AB

Output (stdout)
CodeLAB
```

Case 2:
```
Input (stdin)
Fresh214&grad

Output (stdout)
Freshgrad
```

Case 3:
```
Input (stdin)
BI*0^KE

Output (stdout)
