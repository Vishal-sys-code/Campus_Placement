Class is an entity in C++, which is a named block which consists of variables and functions. 

A class can be used by creating instances of it, which is called as objects.

C++ has it's way to define a sequence of characters as an object of class, called std::string. 

String class stores the characters as a sequence of bytes with a functionality of allowing access to single byte character.

Q.) Please predict the output for the given code. Consider the input string as "Hai all".


#include<iostream> 
#include<string> 
int main() 
{ 
  std::string str; 
  std::getline(std::cin,str); 
  std::cout << "The initial string is : "; 
  std::cout << str << "\n"; 
  str.push_back('s'); 
  std::cout << str << "\n"; 
  str.pop_back(); 
  str.pop_back();
  str.pop_back();
  std::cout << str << "\n"; 
} 


Output: 
The initial string is : Hai all
Hai alls
Hai a
