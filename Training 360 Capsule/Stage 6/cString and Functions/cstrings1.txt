Q.) 
#include<iostream>
#include<cstring>
int main()
{
  char str1[] = "It's Wednesday and it's mid of the week";
  char str2[45];
  strncpy(str2,str1,20);
  std::cout<<str2<< std::endl;
  strncat(str2,str1,25);
  std::cout<<str2<< std::endl;
}

Output: 
It's Wednesday and i
It's Wednesday and iIt's Wednesday and it's m


Some important functions:

memcpy()
memmove()


Q.) 
Prateek is a newbie in C++ programming. He wants to write a program in C++, where he needs to read a string and check whether the string is present.

Solution: 

#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){

 char ptr[100];

 char ch;

 cin.getline(ptr,100);

 cin>>ch;

 if(memchr(ptr,ch,10))

   std::cout << ch << " is present in " << ptr <<"\n";

 else

   std::cout << ch << " is not present in " << ptr << "\n";

}
