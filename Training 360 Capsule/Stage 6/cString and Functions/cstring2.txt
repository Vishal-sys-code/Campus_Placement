Functions: 

strlen()
strcmp(s1,s2)
strncmp(s1,s2,n)
strcoll(s1,s2)
strchr(s1,ch)
strrchr(s1,ch)
strspn(s1,s2)
strcspn(s1,s2)
strpbrk(s1,s2)


Q.) 

#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    char str[] = "This a trial version.";
    char str1[]="George";
    char str2[]="Georgia";
    int len = strlen(str);
    std::cout<<"Length : "<<len<<"\n";
    std::cout<<"Comparison 1 : "<<strcmp(str1,str2)<<"\n";
    std::cout<<"Comparison 2 : "<<strncmp(str1,str2,5)<<"\n";
}

Output: 
Length : 21
Comparison 1 : -4
Comparison 2 : 0
