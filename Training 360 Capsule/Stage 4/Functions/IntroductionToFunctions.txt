Functions are group of statements which are put in a block to perform a particular task.
 
For example, while writing a program you need to read some data again and again. 

Either the programmer can write those lines of code again and again or those lines can be kept in a function and the function can be used anywhere required. 

Thus, usage of functions make code simple, readable and reusable.
